# Pager backend code test

Welcome to the backend team code test!

This test consists of a small REST API that we have already started for you.  

We have already setup 1 endpoint and it's corresponding unit tests.  

The unit tests also include (althought commented out) other unit tests for 2 more endpoints that you need to implement with the help of one of our engineers.

## Setup

This project needs Node (version >= 8) and Docker installed on your machine.

- run `npm i`
- run `docker compose up` in another terminal session
- run `npm test`
- Follow your interviewer instructions on what unit tests you should uncomment and start coding

Thanks and happy coding!

## FAQ

- **How much time do I have?**
-  *You have 60 minutes. There's no rush though, we don't set strict rules around what should have been completed by 60 minutes because that changes between each candidate and their expertise in our stack*

- **Can I search Google if I don't know/remember how to implement something?**
-  *Yes, of course. We do it all the time.*
