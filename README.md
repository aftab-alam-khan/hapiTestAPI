# Pager Backend Node Code Test

Welcome to the backend team code test.

This test consists of a small REST API that we have already started for you.  

We have setup 1 endpoint and it's corresponding unit tests.  

The tests also include (althought commented out) other unit tests for 2 more endpoints that you need to implement with the help of one of our engineers.

## Setup

This project needs Node (version >= 8) and Docker installed on your machine.

- run `npm i`
- run `docker compose up` in another terminal session

- Follow your interviewer instructions on what unit tests you should uncomment and 

## FAQ

- **Can I search Google if I don't know/remember how to implement something?**
-  *Yes, of course. We do it all the time.*
